5. Plot the variance explained by the principal components using a line plot, along with a horizontal line corresponding to the variance equal to one. (2 points)

6. Determine the factor loadings matrix and plot the correlogram along with the factor loadings values (2 decimal precision), employing the heatmap plot from the seaborn package. (2 points)
